# FourSquareTest

FourSquare test for Whitbread interview process.

The aim of the program is to use the FourSquare API to find trending venues in a location that the user searches for.

I wrote the program in native Android code as the test is for the position of an Android Developer.

Constraints:
To use the API to find venues in a location it requires a longitude and latitude to, however I was unable to within a reasonable time
to convert a physical address to co-ordinates so have left the use of hard coded co-ordinates in my URL.
